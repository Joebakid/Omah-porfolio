  SL: Never have I ever not had a secret boyfriendü§≠  <br><br>


  Yeah.. I know, 10-year old me would've been surprised tooüòÇ  <br><br>
  
  If you knew me personally, you'll know why this is quite shocking. <br><br>
  
  
  Ps: My mum will have my head if she finds out ü§ß <br><br>
  
  
  You see, (first name) <br><br>
  
  
  I grew up in a very religious family. Emphasis on the 'very' . The kind of family where wearing trousers as a girl is seen as an abomination, where we're not allowed to use attachments or weavons, even applying facial makeup is perceived as a sin in my family. <br><br>
  
  In secondary school then, my uniform skirt was always the longest in class. I didn't usually get into trouble or break any rules. I was seen as this holy judgy girl that felt like she was the only saint in class, lol. I didn't even play with boys then because I was scared of getting pregnant - what my mum made me believe ü§ß‚Ä¶<br><br>
  
  I was nicknamed‚Ä¶ Our holy sister <br><br>
  
  
  But all that changed when I gained admission to the university. <br><br>
  
  
  There I got to see life from a whole different perspective and it was amazing. <br><br>
  
  
  I met people, I socialized, made new friends, went to places‚Ä¶it felt like I just started living my own life and making my own decisions and it felt good. <br><br>
  
  
  I remember that night, our freshers party‚Ä¶where I met my boyfriend - Adam‚ò∫Ô∏è <br><br>
  
  
  That was the beginning of a new chapter in my life. <br><br>
  
  
  It's been 2 years now, I'm in 300level and I still don't  have the courage to tell my parents. I will one day sha‚Ä¶ <br><br>
  
  Let me just start earning enough money I can use to sustain myself  just in case they decide to kick me out of the house when I tell them üòÖ <br><br>
  
  
  So, yeah I have a boyfriend and no, I'm not pregnant. <br><br>
  
  
  Parents these days should not lie to their kids in order to stop them from doing certain things. I don't really blame them sometimes though, because they might see it as a form of protecting their kids but it's not.<br><br>
  
  
  There's a better approach to raising your teenage children in a Godly way - that doesn't involve you lying to them or raising them with baseless religious beliefs.<br><br>
  
  
  I know you're probably angry at me for what I just said‚Ä¶<br><br>
  
  
  You might be thinking‚Ä¶ <i> " who's this crazy person that wants to teach me how to raise my children? " </i><br><br>
  
  
  Just chill out okay and wait till the 18th of September to attack me, lol. <br><br>
  
  
  Yeah on the 18th I will be hosting a live session for teenagers and parents to express their views on moral issues. <br><br>
