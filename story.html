<h1>A Coming of age story</h1>

<p class="story-lines">
    SL: Never have I ever not had a secret boyfriendü§≠
    
    
    Yeah.. I know, 10-year old me would've been surprised tooüòÇ
    
    If you knew me personally, you'll know why this is quite shocking.
    
    
    Ps: My mum will have my head if she finds out ü§ß
    
    
    You see, (first name)
    
    
    I grew up in a very religious family. Emphasis on the 'very' . The kind of family where wearing trousers as a girl is seen as an abomination, where we're not allowed to use attachments or weavons, even applying facial makeup is perceived as a sin in my family.
    
    In secondary school then, my uniform skirt was always the longest in class. I didn't usually get into trouble or break any rules. I was seen as this holy judgy girl that felt like she was the only saint in class, lol. I didn't even play with boys then because I was scared of getting pregnant - what my mum made me believe ü§ß‚Ä¶
    
    I was nicknamed‚Ä¶ Our holy sister 
    
    
    But all that changed when I gained admission to the university.
    
    
    There I got to see life from a whole different perspective and it was amazing.
    
    
    I met people, I socialized, made new friends, went to places‚Ä¶it felt like I just started living my own life and making my own decisions and it felt good.
    
    
    I remember that night, our freshers party‚Ä¶where I met my boyfriend - Adam‚ò∫Ô∏è
    
    
    That was the beginning of a new chapter in my life.
    
    
    It's been 2 years now, I'm in 300level and I still don't  have the courage to tell my parents. I will one day sha‚Ä¶
    
    Let me just start earning enough money I can use to sustain myself  just in case they decide to kick me out of the house when I tell them üòÖ
    
    
    So, yeah I have a boyfriend and no, I'm not pregnant.
    
    
    Parents these days should not lie to their kids in order to stop them from doing certain things. I don't really blame them sometimes though, because they might see it as a form of protecting their kids but it's not.
    
    
    There's a better approach to raising your teenage children in a Godly way - that doesn't involve you lying to them or raising them with baseless religious beliefs.
    
    
    I know you're probably angry at me for what I just said‚Ä¶
    
    
    You might be thinking‚Ä¶" who's this crazy person that wants to teach me how to raise my children? "
    
    
    Just chill out okay and wait till the 18th of September to attack me, lol.
    
    
    Yeah on the 18th I will be hosting a live session for teenagers and parents to express their views on moral issues.
