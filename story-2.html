    SL: Yesterday Wasn't All Rosy For Me (First name). The thing Is…


Hey (first name)


Trust you slept well? Because I didn't 🤧


I was struggling to breathe with one nostril last night. My airflow was restricted and tears were running down my eyes continuously.


It was so uncomfortable, (first name)... I hope you don't get to experience something like that really.


I should probably have seen it coming because I wore a light dress out today despite the cold weather.


Yeah… stupid of me right?😪


I guess you'd say yes to that, but the thing is…


Mum kept calling out to me to grab a jacket when she saw me all dressed up checking out my outfit in the mirror, but I ignored her. It's not like I didn't want to grab a jacket though, it was what she said after that pissed me off.


She said… "see this spoilt child, so you want to leave this house naked??, See the way you're exposing yourself now for men to start calling you abi?"


Naked howww??


Believe me… what I was putting on was at my knees length. A cross back knee length light floral dress. I wish I could send you a pic of it to see for yourself.


My plan was to wear it with a jean jacket because of the cold obviously.


But no, mummy just saw me and jumped into conclusion 🤦


She cut me off when I tried to explain myself, this got me angry. So, I just grabbed my purse and my phone then walked out of the house while she was shouting… couldn't stand it 🤧


So yeah, I have catarrh and it's totally my fault, lol.


But I feel, if mum had talked to me instead of shouting or if she had just listened to what I had to say, there's no way I would have left the house without wearing that jacket.


The manner in which parents approach their children sometimes, is not nice. To them, they're being all protective and all that, but to the children, they feel attacked and mistrusted. Parents should try to listen to their children, rather than jumping into conclusions…


If you have any contrary opinion to this, kindly write it out somewhere and set your reminder to the 18th of September.


That's when I'll be hosting a live session for parents and teens to iron out a lot of issues.

We all will be waiting to hear your opinion on the whole matter.


See you on the 18th😇


PS: Adam stays in Lagos, we do hang out sometimes during the holidays 😊… that'll be our little secret (first name), don't tell anyone 🤫
